To test your CPUScheduler output:

1. Make a directory for this assignment.

2. Implement all your java programs in this directory.

3. Copy all files in the zip file to this directory. Be sure that the file run_test is executable. If it's not, use this command:
	
	chmod 775 run_test
    
4. To run the test program, execute the following on the command line

   	./run_test probability

   where the argument "probability" can be any value between 0 and 1 (inclusive)

5. You'll find the results of the MaxHeap and PQueue tests in the PQ_output file.
You can also find additional information about the results in your test-output folder.
Just open the index.html in browser.

The results of the CPUScheduler tests are in the diff_output, which should be empty.
